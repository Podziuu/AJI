# Online Store Application
This repository contains two distinct projects related to building an online store application. Each project is described briefly below, with more detailed documentation available in their respective directories.

## Projects Overview
1. API Backend (Project 1)
* Implements the backend functionality required for the store.
* Features include managing products, orders, and user authentication (if implemented).
* Exposes endpoints for client-side applications to interact with the store's data.
* Detailed information about API endpoints and usage is available in the project directory.
2. Frontend Application (Project 2)
* Implements the client-side interface for interacting with the online store.
* Developed using a responsive framework for modern design (e.g., Bootstrap or Materialize).
* Allows users to browse products, filter by name or category, add products to the cart, place orders, and manage orders.
* Advanced features include:
  - Optimizing product descriptions via the backend.
  - User registration and login. 
  - Database initialization by file upload.
  - User reviews for order handling.
 
## Getting Started
Each project has its own set of instructions for installation, setup, and usage. Please refer to the `README.md` files in their respective directories for detailed guidance.

1. API Backend: `backend/README.md`
2. Frontend Application: `frontend/README.md`

## Requirements
